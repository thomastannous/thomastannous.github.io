# About Me

My name is Thomas Tannous.
I am german computer science (BSc) graduate, who tries to find a fun and fulfilling way
through life.

My interest lies programming, engineering, game development, music, art, literature, philosophy and psychology.

On my homepage you can find a showcase of my personal projects.
Whenever I feel like, I know something important, that is missing in the
internet, I will try to write a blog post about it.
Thanks for visiting my page.

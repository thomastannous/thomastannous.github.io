# About Me

My name is Thomas Tannous.
I am a Computer Science (BSc) graduate from Germany. Innovative work for
projects that make the world a less painful and funnier place is my passion.

In particular, I have interest in programming, engineering, music, art,
philosophy and psychology.
On my homepage you can find a showcase of my personal projects.

My hobbies include reading classic books, making music and doing sports.
